# Face-Recognition
this is a personal project. I am building an app that will sort uploaded pictures use face recognition. This is not yet finished. 

I run the .py file in void Linux because I cant run it on Windows, but if you can that would be great. The code was based here: https://github.com/bradtraversy/face_recognition_examples.
